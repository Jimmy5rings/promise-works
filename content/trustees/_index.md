Since late 2004, I’ve worked mainly in the voluntary sector, as charity trustee and fund-raiser, bereavement counselor, school governor, business mentor and RSPB warden & estate worker.

I’ve been a Promise mentor since December 2004 and a trustee of Somerset Trust for Arts & Recreation (STAR) since April 2006.

In my professional career I enjoyed over 30 years in the UK banking sector, specialising in corporate finance, commercial property and credit risk


## Linda Barnett

I retired from the post of Director of Social and Children’s Safeguarding for Somerset County Council in 2012 where, alongside many other responsibilities I chaired the Children’s Safeguarding Board.

I trained as a social worker at Sussex University from 1974-76 and held a wide range of fieldwork and management in Haringey and Somerset during a career spanning almost 40 years. Before taking up my final post, I set up Somerset’s Youth Offending Team.  In 2007 I was awarded the MBE for services to Youth Justice Child Protection.

I have been involved with PROMISE from the outset, having been instrumental in making the very first bid to set it up. I am also a longstanding trustee of STAR and currently its treasurer.

I live in Combwich.  I’m a keen gardener and sing in the Combwich Community Choir.

## Kev O'Donnell (Treasurer)

I took early retirement in 2013 after a general management career within the aerospace industry.  Too old for football, too young for bowls  and with a phobia for gardening, I turned to the voluntary sector for inspiration.

After working as a volunteer buddy with local lads I discovered PROMISE and trained as a mentor in 2014.  I have since joined the Somerset Safeguarding Children Board as a Community Member and very much enjoy being involved in the wider aspects of nurturing our young people and helping them  to fulfil their full potential.

When not volunteering I am usually to be found helping out with my local football team, watching the Wolves or bopping to Northern Soul music.  As they say, you can take the lad out of Wolverhampton….

## Lucy Martin

I have been a civil servant for all of my working life and a Promise mentor since 2013. My work involves helping vulnerable people, including children and young adults, and I sit on many of Somerset County Council Statutory boards.

I believe every child deserves a chance to achieve their aspirations and welcome the opportunity to support some of them on their journey. I am orignally from Tewkesbury but moved to Birmingham as a child. Since 2006 I have lived in Somerset with my two children, both of whom are now grown up. I enjoy the countryside and taking my Labrador, Addis on long walks.  I also enjoy gardening, cooking and live music.

## Madeleine (Maddy) Conway

I have 36 years’ experience as a Social Worker, in London and the South West, specialising in Children. In the last 17 years I have worked specifically with disabled children and for 15 of those years managed a Team. An awareness and knowledge of Safeguarding is essential to the role.  I have delivered Safeguarding training to a variety of professionals and volunteers.

I also work for the Criminal Justice Department with Vulnerable Witnesses, working closely with Police and Courts, mainly in relation to Safeguarding issues.
