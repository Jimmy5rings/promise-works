We are currently seeking companies within Somerset that would like to support a really worthwhile local charity.  It costs just £8-900 per year to fund the average relationship.  If you could help with raising funds then please contact us.

**Would you like to sponsor a relationship….?**

If you can make a two-year commitment to fund a relationship, we would be pleased to give you regular updates, suitably anonymized, so that your organization can see hear how your help is making a difference in the life of a vulnerable young person.

One of the simplest ways to help is to sign up to [Easyfundraising](/easyfundraising) – many of the main office supply, hotel, train and hire companies will give a small percentage donation to your nominated fund at no additional no cost to you.  Sign up now and nominate PROMISEworks (all one word) as your good cause… then sit back and watch how much you raise for us!
