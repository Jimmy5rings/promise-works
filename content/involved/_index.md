# Get Involved

## How you can help

You can help make a significant difference to the lives of Somerset’s most vulnerable young people by [volunteering](http://www.promisevolunteers.org.uk/) to become a mentor, by making a [donation](/donate), by fundraising for us, or by entering into a [corporate partnership](/corporate) with us.

### Mentoring

If you are interested in volunteering as a mentor, **mentoring@promiseworks.org.uk** would love to hear from you.  Volunteers come from all walks of life with different backgrounds and experiences.  Our mentors talk of how hugely rewarding it is on a personal level to volunteer their time in this way.  We do ask, however, that you seriously consider your ability to commit to a relationship lasting at least 2 years.

### Donate

PROMISEworks relies on the generosity of people like you to help us to continue to deliver and grow long-term mentoring in Somerset. The average cost of this is £8-900 per relationship per year.  There are many ways to help us provide this financial support.  You can send a one-off donation online; set up a regular giving payment starting from as little as £5.00 a month or send a donation by post or over the phone.  More information on [ways to donate](/donate)...

### Corporate support

If your organisation is looking for a local Somerset-based charity to support then we would love to [talk to you](/corporate).
