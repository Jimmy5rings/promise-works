description : "Delivering inspirational mentoring for young people in Somerset"
---
PROMISEworks supports a team of trained volunteers who provide a Somerset-wide mentoring service for some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged young people in the county.

In their own words:

“Mentors are like pillars, if they weren’t there, the roof would fall in” – Robbie, aged 19

“Before I had a mentor I wasn’t really in the world.  I feel like I’m here now” – Michael, aged 10  

“My mentor makes me feel like I’m worth something and I’m a better person than I thought! – Hannah, aged 14

We could not continue the fantastic work done by our volunteers without the support of the people and businesses of Somerset.
