# Donate

## Where your money goes

It costs approximately £1,500 a year to support the average mentoring relationship.  This covers the cost of a small, central team of support staff; volunteer mileage and other incidental expenses.  Mentoring delivers direct benefits to vulnerable young people.  In turn, these positive changes influence their attitudes and actions, significantly reducing offending and antisocial behavior.  Thus, local communities can also see direct benefits from the help delivered to these young people.

## Donate when you shop online!

If you register with Easyfundraising, PROMISEworks could receive a small donation whenever you shop online at over 2,500 retailers!   It takes only a couple of minutes to register and it costs you nothing extra – the retailer pays a small commission.  You will need to register PROMISEworks (all one word) as your chosen cause.  If you sign up for their ‘Find and Remind’ service, you’ll never miss an opportunity to donate and you’ll be given a running total of how much has been raised (by you personally and overall).
